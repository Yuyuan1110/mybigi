## Daily Essay

Based on my work as a Linux kernel developer, Gemini recommended I learn the following tools to enhance my skills:

### For Code Navigation
- **`cscope` & `ctags`**: For indexing the kernel source and quickly finding function definitions, calls, and symbols.
- **`clangd`**: A Language Server to get IDE-like features (e.g., go-to-definition) in a terminal editor.

### For Deeper Debugging & Tracing
- **`QEMU`**: To emulate hardware and test kernel builds in a VM before flashing to a physical device. Allows for full kernel debugging with GDB.
- **`ftrace`**: The kernel's built-in tracer for low-overhead tracing of functions and events.
- **`bpftrace` / BPF**: The modern in-kernel framework for advanced performance analysis and tracing.
- **`crash`**: For post-mortem analysis of kernel crash dumps (`vmcore`).

### For the Build and Boot Process
- **`LLVM/Clang`**: An alternative compiler to GCC, which is important for building the Chromebook kernel.
- **`U-Boot` / `coreboot`**: Bootloaders used in Chromebooks. Understanding them is key for debugging boot issues.
- **`mkinitcpio` / `dracut`**: Tools for creating the `initramfs`, which is often customized for new hardware.
